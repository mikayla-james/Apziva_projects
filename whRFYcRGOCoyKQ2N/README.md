The goal of this project was to predict whether a customer is happy based on their responses to survey questions. After cleaning and preparing the dataset, I explored the distribution of responses and identified variables most associated with customer satisfaction. I initially considered removing outliers, but due to the limited data size, this led to worse predictability, so they were retained. Several models were tested, with tree-based methods such as Random Forest and XGBoost performing best and achieving an accuracy above 73% target. To validate results, I regraphed the relationship between survey questions and customer satisfaction using predicted values, which closely followed the general patterns of the observed values. Overall, the project met its objective, though I stress the importance of gathering more samples to improve the reliability and generalizability of future models.
